# Week5 exercise I

As we are reaching the middle of our course, we want to make sure our app is up to date and all the pages are taking in dynamic data.

Please connect the /likes, /library, and /profile page to the API.

You will have to create 2 new request.js functions, fetchAllLikes, which makes a request to labs or candidates depending on the role. And you will have to change the fetchProfile, and fetchMatches methods in order to fetch based on roles.

Furthermore, make sure that on the Library page, you toggle data between `all` and `matches` when clicking on the filter.
