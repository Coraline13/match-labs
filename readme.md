# Week5 Exercise II

Add a GoBack component that we can use on any page of the app and onClick on the component, it should redirect to the previous page visited.

We will use this component on the Profile page.

Example:
When we navigate to homepage -> Profile, and we click on the <GoBack/> component, we should be sent back to the homepage.
